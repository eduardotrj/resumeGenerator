Dear Hiring Manager,

In my current role, I have successfully designed and optimized REST APIs using Python (FastAPI, Django) for scalable applications, deployed backend services on AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, API Gateway), and enhanced database efficiency through SQL query optimization. These achievements demonstrate my ability to work with a variety of languages, frameworks, and tools, aligning perfectly with your company's expectations.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work on AI and Machine Learning projects, which aligns with my interests and experience in these areas. My degree in Computer Science has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles, and I have continued to develop my skills through hands-on experience with modern backend technologies such as Microservice infrastructure using Event-Driven architecture, RabbitMQ, AsyncAPI, and Kubernetes.

I am excited about the opportunity to join your team of talented engineers and contribute to building innovative AI solutions that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible. With 3 days a week in the office at Notting Hill, I look forward to collaborating with your team and learning from their expertise.
